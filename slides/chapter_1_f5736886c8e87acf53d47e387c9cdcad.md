`@script`
So far for this report, we have handled null values and converted data types.  We're almost done.  In previous exercises, may have noticed that some of the strings looked odd, which is common in practice. To clean these messy strings, we need to leverage STRONG PARSING functions.

Here's it the current state of our report.  Several of the values include extra characters, and groupings do not exist where they should.  Our goal is to get to this stage on the right, where we only include one row for each country.
